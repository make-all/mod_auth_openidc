Preferably you should use one of the pre-compiled binary packages, available for
various platforms, see:
  https://github.com/pingidentity/mod_auth_openidc/wiki#11-where-can-i-get-binary-packages
and proceed with the Configuration section below.

If your platform is not supported or you want to run the latest code,
you can build from source as described below.

To get the OAuth 2.0 Code Authorization Grant changes, you will need to build
from source. No binary modules are available, and no plan is made to support
binary modules due to the fact that this implementation is less secure than
the upstream project, and I have no desire to have naive users accidentally
stumble on this when they could have used the upstream's binaries instead.

Installation from source
========================

You will require development headers and tools for the following
dependencies:
 Apache (>=2.0)
 cjose (>=0.4.1)
 OpenSSL (>=0.9.8) (>=1.0.1 for Elliptic Curve support)
 Curl (>=?)
 Jansson (>=2.0) (JSON parser for C)
 pcre3 (>=?) (Regular Expressions support)
 pkg-config

and if you want Redis support:
 hiredis (>=0.9.0) (Redis client for C)


Configure, make and install with:

(run ./autogen.sh first if you work straight from the github source tree)
./configure --with-apxs2=/opt/apache2/bin/apxs2
make
make install

Note that, depending on your distribution,  apxs2 may be named apxs.

Configuration
=============

Edit the configuration file for your web server. Depending on
your distribution, it may be named '/etc/apache/httpd.conf' or something
different.

You need to add a LoadModule directive for mod_auth_openidc. This will
look similar to this:

LoadModule auth_openidc_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_auth_openidc.so

To find the full path to mod_auth_openidc.so, you may run:

apxs2 -q LIBEXECDIR

This will print the path where Apache stores modules. mod_auth_openidc.so
will be stored in that directory.

After you have added the LoadModule directive, you must add the configuration
for mod_auth_openidc. For a quickstart doing so, see the provided samples
in the README.md file.

For an exhaustive overview of all configuration primitives, see: auth_openidc.conf
